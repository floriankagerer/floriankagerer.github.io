Kreecha Puphaiboon's algorithm {{banpu}} ranked **3rd**. It achieved a score of **0.067303**. Congratulations!

*Kreecha submitted the following description*: 
The algorithm uses Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search combined with heuristic packing strategies. It iteratively
destroys and repairs pallet configurations through operators with adaptive weights, learning which strategies work
best through extreme point placement.

We really look forward to reading the publication.
